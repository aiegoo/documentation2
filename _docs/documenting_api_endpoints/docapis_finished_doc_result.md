Let's pull together the various parts we've worked on and bring them together to showcase the full example.

<div class="docSample">
{% include_relative surfreport_resource_description.html %}
{% include_relative surfreport_endpoint.html %}
{% include_relative surfreport_parameters.html %}
{% include_relative surfreport_request.html %}
{% include_relative surfreport_response.html %}
</div>

And that's it. If you have a lot of endpoints to document, you'll probably want to create templates that follow a common structure. Better yet, when you push your reference documentation into the OpenAPI specification, it makes publishing your content even easier. We'll dive more into the OpenAPI specification in the next section, [OpenAPI spec and generated reference docs](restapispecifications.html).

## Next steps

Now that you've completed the [API reference tutorial](docapis_api_reference_tutorial_overview.html), you're ready to do some activities. There are two activities in this section:

* [Activity: Find an open-source project](docapis_find_open_source_project.html)
* [Activity: Evaluate API reference docs](docapis_api_reference_activity.html)
